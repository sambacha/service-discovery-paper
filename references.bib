abstract = {Self-organizing, structured peer-to-peer (p2p) overlay networks like CAN, Chord, Pastry and Tapestry offer a novel platform for a variety of scalable and decentralized distributed applications. These systems provide efficient and fault-tolerant routing, object location, and load balancing within a self-organizing overlay network.One major problem with these systems is how to bootstrap them. How do you decide which overlay to join? How do you find a contact node in the overlay to join? How do you obtain the code that you should run? Current systems require that each node that participates in a given overlay supports the same set of applications, and that these applications are pre-installed on each node.In this position paper, we sketch the design of an infrastructure that uses a universal overlay to provide a scalable infrastructure to bootstrap multiple service overlays providing different functionality. It provides mechanisms to advertise services and to discover services, contact nodes, and service code.},

PAST is based on a self-organizing, Internet-based overlay network of storage nodes that cooperatively route file queries, store multiple replicas of files, and cache additional copies of popular files.In the PAST system, storage nodes and files are each assigned uniformly distributed identifiers, and replicas of a file are stored at nodes whose identifier matches most closely the file's identifier. This statistical assignment of files to storage nodes approximately balances the number of files stored on each node. However, non-uniform storage node capacities and file sizes require more explicit storage load balancing to permit graceful behavior under high global storage utilization; likewise, non-uniform popularity of files requires caching to minimize fetch distance and to balance the query load.We present and evaluate PAST, with an emphasis on its storage management and caching system. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that the system minimizes fetch distance, that it balances the query load for popular files, and that it displays graceful degradation of performance as the global storage utilization increases beyond 95%.},

The CAN is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation.},
