\section{System and threat models}
\label{sec:model}

%\michal{Say we build on top of the DHT. What do we need from the DHT?}
%\michal{Those are speerate layers.}
In this section, we present \sysname network and threat models as well as objectives of our protocol. 

\subsection{System Model}
We assume a network of nodes. At startup time, each node generates a public/secret key pair, which it uses to secure point-to-point communication with its peers. Nodes are identified by their \emph{node ID}, which is simply the hash of their public key. Multiple nodes may share the same IP address (due to NAT or being hosted by the same physical machine). However, two nodes cannot share the same ID.

\sysname, is built on the existing Ethereum DHT, \ie nodes use the Ethereum DHT to bootstrap and initially discover nodes to fill their tables.\mk{This might be confusing (e.g., what tables?). Shall we just say that we assume that nodes are valready members of the Ethereum DHT?} Specifically, we designed and implemented our system as an extension of Ethereum's \emph{Node Discovery Protocol v5 (discv5)}. However, the operation of service discovery is not Ethereum-specific and could also be implemented using a different DHT.\mk{Is it a good place to mention that we assume the DHT to be secure?}

\sysname indexes participants according to \emph{topics}. A topic is an identifier for a
service or application provided by a node. Topics are 256-bit integers, like node IDs.
A node providing a certain service (topic), is said to \emph{register} an advertisement for itself when it registers the ad on a registrar to make itself discoverable under that topic. Depending on the needs of the application, a node can advertise multiple topics or no topics at all. We assume that the popularity of topics in the system may vary significantly and follows a power law distribution~\cite{kim2018measuring}. Anyone can participate in registering and searching for (one or more) topics and uses the same ID and IP for all its topics. 

Nodes fulfill the following roles in the network:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Registrar} - accepts advertisements and responds to topic queries. When asked for a specific topic, a registrar responds with nodes that registered ads for the topic.  All DHT nodes act as Registrars. A Registrar accepts and stores advertisements for any topic.
    \item \textbf{Advertiser} - registers for a specific topic and wants to be discovered by its peers. The advertisers make themselves discoverable by placing advertisements. Nodes are advertisers for every topic/service it provides.
    \item \textbf{Searcher} - attempts to discover nodes for a specific topic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Threat Model}
Our system is designed to operate in an adversarial environment, \ie. the Internet. We assume the presence of malicious actors in the DHT that may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol%. These actors do not strictly follow the protocol when communicating with others and attempt to influence the discovery results of honest nodes by steering them toward the attacker-controlled nodes.

Security of the service discovery mechanism against attacks is fundamentally dependent on the security guarantees provided by the underlying DHT implementation. This is because the DHT's basic protocol is used to initialize and maintain the data structures used by the service discovery layer. We assume that no honest node is fully eclipsed by the malicious ones, \ie each honest DHT node has at least one honest peer. 

Malicious actors can spawn multiple virtual nodes within one physical machine and thus control many Sybil node IDs. Maintaining nodes in the DHT requires infrastructure resources (public IP addresses) and we assume the resources under the control of an attacker are limited. Specifically, we assume that it is easier for an attacker to generate similar IP addresses (\ie within a single subnet) than it is to control many diverse IP addresses (with different prefixes). We use the number of IP addresses and IDs under the control of an attacker as parameters for our evaluation in Section \ref{sec:eval}.

\mk{To consider: end the model here and move the malicious behaviour list to the evaluation?}

Through an extensive literature review\cite{chen2020survey, henningsen2019eclipsing}, we collect a list malicious behaviours that an attacker can use to disrupt a DHT-based service discovery protocol:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Malicious DHT Peer} - DHT routing relies on asking peers for other nodes, closer to a specific target (\eg MSG\_FIND, MSG\_GET). When responding to those messages, an attacker returns uniquely other malicious nodes trying to hijack the DHT traversal process of honest nodes.
    \item \textbf{Malicious Registrar} - when queried for a specific topic, it returns a maximum amount of malicious nodes \footnote{Alternatively, a malicious registrar could simply refuse to respond. However, such behaviour is less effective than returning malicious peers}. 
    \item \textbf{Spamming Advertisers} - an attacker bombards honest registrars with malicious advertisers. The attack can be performed for a single or multiple topics. The attack may cause an honest registrar to refuse honest advertisement due to the lack of resources (both storage and CPU power), and return malicious advertisements of the spammer when queried by honest searchers. 
    \item \textbf{Generic Spammers} - an attacker bombards an honest registrar with topic queries or random traffic hoping to exhaust bandwidth or CPU power. However, we consider such attacks less of a threat as: \textit{(i)} they require a symmetric amount of resources used by the attacker to establish and maintain a secure connection, \textit{(ii)} can be easily countered by sending rate limits (\eg based on the source IP address or Proof-of-Work puzzles). 
    \item \michal{We also have some \sysname-specific attacks (\eg trying to return high waiting times to slow down/stop an honest registration process. However, it's too early to introduce them here. Maybe we can just analyse it in a discussion section after introducing the protocol?}
\end{itemize}

Adversaries can strategically target specific nodes or regions in the DHT ID space (\ie by generating Sybil Node IDs within the desired region of the DHT ID space) with those attacks. We assume presence of attackers that can combine some or all of the behaviours above and coordinate their actions to maximize their effect. 

\subsection{Objectives}
Under the threat model, \sysname achieves the following properties.

\para{Efficiency} \sysname is efficient in terms of messages exchanged, the number of contacted nodes, computation and storage requirements for both lookup and registration operations. The message exchanged and the number of contacted nodes increase logarithmically with the number of system participants. Placing an ad and processing an incoming registration request involve only simple operations involving a constant amount of computational resources. The storage usage for the registrars is limited by a configurable, but fixed amount regardless of the incoming traffic. 

\michal{Time to discover (should we measure that? maybe just make sure that everyone is discovered the same number of time under fairness below?)}

\michal{An equal load balance might be too strong for us. We do have some minor (but still) differences in the traffic received}
\para{Fairness} \sysname ensures an equal load balance across systems participants and DHT regions (\ie avoids hotspots). The system provides efficient lookup and registration operations for all the participants regardless of the topic they look up/register for. Each advertiser has a similar chance of being discovered by its peers. 

\para{Security} \sysname focuses specifically on preventing \emph{Denial of Service} (nodes are unable/slow to discover their application-specific peers) and \emph{Eclipse} (nodes discover uniquely malicious nodes) attacks. While completely eliminating such attacks in an open networkis technically impossible, \sysname provides efficiency and fairness for all the honest participants under the presence of a powerful attacker and increases the cost of launching such attacks. We provide a complete list of malicious behaviours \sysname protects from in \Cref{sec:eval}. 

\mk{We could also list as a requirement the attackers not being able to create state just by spamming request. I guess it'd go in security}
