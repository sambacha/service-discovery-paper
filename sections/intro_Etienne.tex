With about 23,500 nodes~\cite{discv4-dns-lists}, \oa{this is the number of discoverable nodes, not necessarily the size of the network.} Ethereum is one of the largest decentralized platform currently in operation.
While it is widely known for supporting the blockchain of the same name (also known as the \emph{mainnet}), the Ethereum platform is also home to a number of additional decentralized applications.
This includes blockchains used for test purposes (testnets such as \emph{Ropsted}, \emph{Rinkeby}, or \emph{G\"orli}), divergent blockchains resulting from a past fork (\emph{Ethereum classic}), alternative cryptocurrencies (\emph{Pirl}, \emph{Musicoin}), exchange markets (\emph{Binance}), content delivery networks (\emph{Swarm}), or messaging applications (\emph{Whisper}).
An official Ethereum crawler~\cite{discv4-dns-lists} indicates that the platform already features almost 500 applications, and this number will keep growing in the future.

All nodes in the Ethereum platform participate to a \emph{global} peer-to-peer (P2P) network operating a distributed hash table (DHT)~\cite{maymounkov2002kademlia}.
% This global DHT is primarily used for periodic node discovery. % and not as a key-value store (i.e., lookup operations are never used).
% The initial entry in the DHT leverages \emph{bootstrap nodes} operated by the Ethereum foundation, that provide a set of initial contact points, but subsequent maintenance of each nodes' view rely on periodic collection of random peers through DHT lookups. \er{Felix prefers not to discuss this and this is arguably out of scope.}
In addition to joining the global network, every node connects to at least one \emph{sub-network} formed of peers participating to its application(s) of interest. \oa{A node could join more than one sub-networks at a time.}
The size of these sub-networks can vary significantly.
\Cref{fig:ecosystem} depicts the size distribution of Ethereum's main sub-networks.
This distribution features a \emph{long tail}, with a vast majority of applications formed of a few hundred nodes or less, much less than the mainnet or even than any of the testnets.
\mk{We might add some more exciting claims here - "this can become a backbone of the new decentralised Internet/Web3"? From the current description the problem doesn't seem that important.}
In the future, we expect the number of applications to grow significantly, as the Ethereum platform will be selected as the base operation layer by emerging decentralized Internet (web3) projects, amongst other applications.
% Every node in the Ethereum platform participates to a \emph{global} peer-to-peer (P2P) network operating the Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT)~\cite{maymounkov2002kademlia}. \er{how many nodes in this global network?}
% Bootstrapping membership to this general network is handled by a number of trusted \emph{bootstrap nodes} operated by the Ethereum foundation, who provide an initial list of contact peers to nodes entering the network.
% Once joined, every node must connect to one or more sub-network(s) formed of peers participating to its application(s) of interest.
% The size of these sub-networks can vary significantly.
% \Cref{fig:ecosystem} depicts the size distribution of the platform main applications.
% This distribution features a \emph{long tail}, with a vast majority of applications formed of a few thousand nodes or less, much less than the mainnet or even than the testnets. \er{would be useful to give more precise quantiles, e.g., 80\% have less than 1.000 nodes, 90\% less than 200 nodes, etc.}

In this paper, we focus on the \emph{service discovery} mechanism, by which a node participating to the global P2P network discovers an application sub-network.
This mechanism returns a set of peers that are used as entry points to the P2P overlay specific to that application, as illustrated by \Cref{fig:subnetwork}.

\end{figure}

Service discovery is a particularly sensitive mechanism in the Ethereum platform.
Its implementation must ensure that malicious participants to this open network are unable to bias its execution against a victim node or sub-network--and that, despite the ability of these adversaries to operate multiple Sybil identities.
Of particular importance is the protection against \emph{eclipse} attacks, where an adversary would lure its victim(s) into a sub-network formed of only nodes under its control. %, i.e., by returning only such nodes to a service discovery request.
Similarly, an adversary may run \emph{denial-of-service} attacks against a specific application, preventing other nodes from discovering peers from the associated sub-network.
On the other hand, the mechanism must remain efficient and scalable.
It is not desirable, in particular, that it relies solely on a fixed set of dedicated registrar nodes maintaining the membership of each application, both for scalability and robustness reasons. Registrar nodes for popular applications could quickly become overwhelmed, and be easy target for attackers.
% attackers would have efficient strategies to place Sybils on the path to registrar nodes, or act as such nodes themselves.
In addition, the need to provision dedicated registrar nodes would be a hindrance to the emergence of new applications and (initially) small sub-networks.
% \oa{I would just say that a fixed set of registrar nodes would be an easy target for attackers} \er{fixed}
% \er{also the applications may want to hide themselves (but this clashes completely with our announcement approach)}

The current service discovery mechanism used in the Ethereum platform is part of \discv~\cite{discv4}, a set of protocols leveraging the global DHT.
It employs a simple but robust \emph{random walk} approach.
A node willing to join an application's sub network simply contacts individually a series of nodes collected from random lookups on the DHT, repeatedly checking application membership until it has collected enough peers participating to this target application. % to join the sub-network.
This approach offers good resilience to malicious behaviors
% , and in particular against denial-of-service attacks, 
but it suffers from very poor scalability and performance, in particular for small sub-networks.
As more applications join the DHT, the inefficiency of the random discovery process becomes a bottleneck for the entire ecosystem. \mk{While other alternative solutions for peer sampling have been proposed, they are impractical~\hl{[]}, based on unrealistic assumptions~\hl{[]} or insecure~\hl{[]} and not used in real-life. We provide an extensive analysis of these systems in \Cref{sec:related}.} \er{not sure which papers you want to highlight here specifically?}
% While using the Kademlia DHT as a key/value store to maintain membership information at a specific node or replica group would allow deterministic lookup of this information, regardless of the application's popularity, this solution would suffer from very poor robustness to attacks and would lead to hotspots and overload for nodes in charge of popular services.

\textbf{Contributions.}
%
We detail in this paper \sysname, a novel service discovery mechanism for large-scale, decentralized platforms and its application to Ethereum.
\sysname targets a balance between robustness, i.e., the ability to resist malicious behaviors and Sybil identities, efficiency, i.e., fast service discovery even for small applications, and good load-balance over participating nodes.
\sysname is integrated in \emph{discv5}~\cite{discv5} (\ie, Node Discovery protocol version 5) a new set of P2P protocols replacing \emph{discv4} in future versions of Ethereum. \er{ideally add a reference or two here}

After providing background knowledge and reviewing the current service discovery mechanism of Ethereum in \Cref{sec:background}, and detailing our system and thread models in \Cref{sec:model}, we detail \sysname as follows.

In \Cref{sec:placement}, we present how this new protocol enables nodes, members of application sub-networks, to \emph{advertise} their membership to these applications in the form of \emph{service advertisements}.
Any node can act as a \emph{registrar} and store advertisements for any topic.
In contrast with a direct use of the DHT as a key-value store, however, in \sysname service advertisements propagate to a pseudo-random subset of all nodes in the global network.
The density of advertisements for an application increases as a DHT lookup approaches its associated key in the DHT overlay structure.\mk{We don't cover lookup. The description may be also downplaying the contribution.}\er{I am not sure to understand this comment, might need to discuss it.}
% As such, \sysname enables efficient lookup of advertisements for any given service.

Robustness, load balancing, and efficiency for the discovery of smaller sub-networks all rely on a novel \emph{admission protocol}, by which registrars accept or reject incoming service advertisements.
This mechanism is detailed in \Cref{sec:registration}.
It ensures that advertisers cannot effectively flood advertisements at a registrar even when deviating from the protocol or operating Sybils, and that less popular topics get sufficiently high probability to be represented and looked up. \er{not sure about this sentence, we do not provide any bound, this is all probabilistic.} \er{I did not keep the comment about the intermediary state as I am not sure what it is about.}

At the core our novel admission protocol lies the need for registrants to respect a waiting time imposed by the registrars before being able to successfully register their advertisement.
We discuss the design and dynamics of the waiting function in \Cref{sec:waitingTime}.
The function allows limiting the amount of resources used by each node, promotes diversity of topic advertisements stored by each node, and protects against a vast range of malicious behaviors.

We implemented \sysname in a simulator as well as in the code base of \emph{discv5}. \michal{Mentioned it's schedule to be included in discv5.}
We intend to release the full code and dataset of our experiment open source with the unblinded version of this paper.
