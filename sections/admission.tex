\section{Admission Protocol}\label{sec:admission}
In this section, we describe a registration procedure followed by an advertiser to place an ad on a specific registrar.

\subsection{Challenge}
Registrars have a limited amount memory and can store only a finite number of ads. If the registration demand surpasses the supply each registrar has to decide which ads should be admitted. In an open system, implementing a simple replacement policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Most recently used (MRU) exposes the system to an attacker that bombards registrars with dummy ads and evicts honest ads.

\sysname solves this problems by using a lightweight \textit{waiting-time-based admission mechanism} for access control. When an advertiser sends an ad placement request to a registrar, the registrar will calculate an amount of time the advertisers needs to wait before being admitted (\ie the waiting time). We explain the waiting time calculations in \Cref{sec:waitingTime}. The advertiser will have to wait a reported waiting time by the registrar and only then the advertiser will be able to place a registration that will be admitted by the registrar. The waiting time is calculated based on the diversity of the request (\ie how different is the request from ads already in the registry) and space left in the registry. 

\subsection{Data Structures}
\para{Advertisement}
When advertisers send a registration request, they send an \emph{advertisement} (\emph{ad} in short). The ad contains the IP address of the advertiser, the ID of the advertiser, the topic the ad is for and additional information needed to later contact the advertiser (\eg an application-specific port number). In the remaining part of the paper, we omit the additional information for brevity. 

\para{Ad cache}
Registrars store received ads locally in a data structure called a \emph{ad cache}. Each ad stored in the ad cache has an associated expiry time, after which the ad is automatically removed. Once an ad is added to the cache, the expiry time is set to a fixed value $a$\mk{TODO:make sure we're consistent with ad lifetime, expire time etc. + use the same symbols}. The ad cache acts as a \emph{first in, first out} queue for ads. The total size of the ad cache is limited by $C_\textit{ad\_cache}$. \sysname does not impose topic/IP/ID-specific limits on the content of the \emph{ad cache}. \mk{Explain why?}
A single advertiser may place at most one ad for a specific topic in the ad cache (registration requests for ads already in the cache are ignored).
However, an advertiser may attempt to place ads for multiple topics at the same registrar.

\para{Ticket}
Tickets are immutable objects issued by registrars to advertisers when receiving a registration request. Each ticket contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ad - repeated registration request (as described above). 
    \item Initial timestamp - the local time at the registrar when the ad was received for the first time, $t_\textit{init}$
    \item Waiting time - the waiting time calculated by the advertiser for the ad, $t_\textit{waiting}$. We describe the details on waiting time calculation in \Cref{sec:waitingTime}. 
\end{itemize}
The tickets are digitally signed by the issuing advertiser. 

\subsection{Registration Procedure}
An advertiser willing to register an ad at a registrar starts by sending an
initial request uniquely containing the ad itself. Based on the
content of the ad cache and the registration, the registrar calculates an
ad-specific waiting time. The advertiser then issues a ticket including the
calculated waiting time and the time of receiving the initial request and sends it back to the advertiser.

The advertiser waits for the indicated time and attempts to register again. The consecutive registration request must include the last ticket issued by the registrar. Tickets can be used uniquely during a registration window:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:registration_window}
    t_\textit{window} = [t_\textit{init} + t_\textit{waiting}, t_\textit{init} + t_\textit{waiting} + \delta t_\textit{window}]
\end{equation}
All the registration requests outside the registration window are ignored by the advertiser. The registrar calculates the registration windows based on the content of the ticket. $\delta t_\textit{window}$ should be chosen to accommodate for the maximum delay between the advertiser and the registrar. 

The advertiser calculates a new waiting time, based on the current content of
the ad cache, every time it receives a registration request (with or without
ticket). The waiting time in the ticket is used only to calculate the
registration windows and prevent advertisers from trying to register
continuously. The ticket also allows the calculation of an accumulated waiting time:
\begin{equation}
    t_\textit{cumulative} = \textit{now} - t_\textit{init}
\end{equation}
An ad is admitted iff the accumulated waiting time is equal or larger than the calculated waiting time $t_\textit{cumulative} \ge t_\textit{waiting}$\footnote{Note that a registration request without a ticket may be admitted directly if $t_\textit{waiting}=0$.}. For registration requests without a ticket $t_\textit{cumulative} = 0$. An advertiser that misses its registration window (as specified by the most recent ticket), loses all its cumulative waiting time and must attempt to re-register without a ticket. Once an ad is admitted, the registrar confirms the registration to the advertiser.

If the cumulative time is not sufficient, $t_\textit{accumulated} < t_\textit{waiting}$, the registrar issues a new ticket and the advertiser repeats the whole procedure. With consecutive registration attempts, advertisers increase their cumulative waiting time $t_\textit{cumulative}$ and eventually will be admitted.

\end{figure}

The inclusion of issue-time allows the registrars to prioritise advertisers
that have been waiting the longest, as we explain later. Because the tickets
are immutable (i.e., tampering with the ticket is detectable by the registrars
that originally issued the ticket), when a registrar issues a new ticket (in
case a registration is not immediately successful) to an advertiser, the
registrar simply copies the issue-time from the last issued ticket and uses that as the issue-time of the new ticket. This means that the registrars are not required to maintain any state for each on-going ticket request given that they can simply verify the authenticity of the ticket in the incoming registration requests.



An advertiser gives up and stops the registration process with a registrar when
it receives $r$ unsuccessful registration attempts (i.e., after being issued $r$
tickets without being admitted). In this case, the advertiser removes the registrar from its advertise table and selects a new node located in the same bucket and attempts a new registration procedure.
%\michal{Is the below true? Shouldn't we try to register at the same node?}
%\sergi{We dont use the same, we pick another randomly. we could use the same but i think for diversity could be better  this way}
Similarly,  after the expiration of a previously placed ad the node is removed from the advertise table and the process is restarted with a new node picked from the local route table\footnote{We assume a common expiration time for all the registrar. However, each registrar may choose to implement its own expiration time and communicate it to advertisers in the confirmation message}.
