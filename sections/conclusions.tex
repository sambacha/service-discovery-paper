\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}
On the foundational level \sysname is the first practical, secure and efficient service discovery protocol that can be deployed in large, real-world P2P networks. It combines the efficiency of traditional DHT operations with security inherited from pseudo-random ad placement. Our novel admission protocol, while performing only simple mathematical calculations, protects against a wide range of malicious behaviours, ensures equal load distribution and promotes diversity in the network.
\sysname is fully integrated with the Discv5~\cite{discv5}, a new P2P protocol suite, and is scheduled for deployment in the future versions of the Ethereum platform. 
An interesting future direction is to add Sybil identities detection mechanism~\cite{cholez2010efficient} and automatically modify systems parameters to operate in a more secure, but more costly, mode (\eg by decreasing the maximum number of ads retrieved from a single registrar).
